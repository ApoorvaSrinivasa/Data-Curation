# Data-Curation
CS-531 Foundations of Data Curation, Fall 2018

## Context of the project
A government agency tracks complaints made by customers against financial institutions, like banks and lending companies. The agency has switched systems for managing its complaint data, and this requires a transfer of complaint data from the old system into the new system.

This this project, an attempt has been made to assess the quality of the data transfer, especially to ensure equivalence of the data in the old and new systems. First, we create a DTD for each XML file. The comparision is achieved by canonicalizing the two files and checking MD5 checksums of the two files.

Please refer to the Project Report for the entire process and decisions taken.
